#Welcome to the Daily Texan's GitHub Repository!
###This is an overview of our (the tech department) procedures and guidelines. 
The basics:
* We create interactives for the Daily Texan, develop online news features, and are responsible for the Texan's website.
* This GitHub organization will contain repositories for our features, templates, guidelines, and anything else that falls under a VCS purview. Everything we do is open source and available to the public.
